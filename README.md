# Pythonrapidtest
 Goal is to check your educational ability and velocity.

Requirements:
1.The code must be available in a GitHub repository or as a project archive.
2. A list of all dependencies (if any) must be stored in requirements.txt, so they can be installed with the command:
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Development should be done inside a virtualenv, but the virtualenv directory itself must be added to .gitignore.
4. Each task should be implemented as an executable script.
5. If the task does not specify where the input data should come from, it must be read from a JSON file.
 Examples of such JSON files should be stored in the project directory.
 The file path should be specified as a string within the program body.
6. The process of serializing the JSON file content should be implemented as a library function, which can be imported when needed.

Tasks:
1. Sort a dictionary with integer values in ascending and descending order.
2. Merge multiple (2 to N) dictionaries into one.
3. Find the three keys with the highest values in a dictionary.
4. Convert an integer to a string in any number system (base).
5. Output the first n rows of Pascal’s Triangle.
 In this triangle, the edges are 1s, and each internal number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.
6. Check whether a given string is a palindrome.
 A palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the same forwards and backwards.
7. Convert a comma-separated string of numbers (from user input) into a list and a tuple.
8. Output the first and last element of a given array.
9. Determine a file’s extension from its full path.
 If the extension cannot be determined, raise an exception.
10. Print even numbers from a given list and stop if you encounter the number 237.
11. Accept two lists and output all elements from the first list that are not in the second.
12. Output a list of all files in a user-specified directory path.
 If the path does not exist, raise an exception.
 Print files to the console, sorted by last modification date.
13. Sum all digits of a user-provided integer.
14. Count how many times a given character appears in a string.
15. Use an anonymous (lambda) function to extract numbers divisible by 15 from a list.
16. Check if all numbers in a sequence are unique.
17. From the provided text, print two words: the most frequent word and the longest word.
